# Restaurant QR Ordering System

## Project Proposal

### Executive Summary

This restaurant management system modernizes the dining experience through QR code-based ordering, enabling customers to browse menus, place orders, and track their order status in real-time. The system provides role-based access for administrators, cashiers, and waiters, streamlining restaurant operations and improving customer satisfaction.

### Problem Statement

Traditional restaurant ordering processes often involve:

- Long wait times for customers to place orders
- Communication gaps between customers, waiters, and kitchen staff
- Difficulty tracking order status and history
- Manual menu updates that don't reflect real-time availability
- Limited visibility into customer preferences and order patterns

### Proposed Solution

A comprehensive QR code-based ordering system that connects customers directly with restaurant staff through a web application, featuring:

#### Customer Features

- **QR Code Table Booking**: Customers scan a table-specific QR code to access the ordering system
- **Smart Customer Recognition**: New customers complete a registration form, while returning customers have their details auto-filled from local storage
- **Order History Tracking**: Returning customers can view their complete order history
- **Queue Management**: Display of queue number when orders are pending attention
- **Real-time Menu Availability**: Automatic validation of menu item availability before order confirmation
- **Order Status Tracking**: Live updates on order preparation and delivery status

#### Staff Features

**Admin Capabilities:**

- Full system oversight and management
- Exclusive order cancellation privileges
- Menu item management (add, edit, delete, activate/deactivate)
- Revenue tracking with customizable date range filtering
- Access to performance analytics and reporting
- Staff management

**Cashier Capabilities:**

- Order status management based on preparation progress
- Order processing and payment handling
- Access to current orders for assigned tables
- View menu items and current availability

**Waiter Capabilities:**

- View orders assigned to their tables
- Update order delivery status
- Customer assistance and communication

#### Technical Features

- **Real-time Synchronization**: Menu changes and order updates propagate instantly across all connected clients
- **Availability Validation**: Pre-submission checks ensure all selected items are currently available
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions based on user roles
- **Local Storage Integration**: Seamless customer recognition and data persistence
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile and desktop devices

### System Workflow

1. **Customer Arrival**: Customer scans QR code at their table
2. **Registration/Recognition**: System checks local storage for existing customer data
3. **Menu Browsing**: Customer views available menu items in real-time
4. **Order Placement**: Customer selects items and submits order
5. **Availability Verification**: System validates all items are still available
6. **Order Assignment**: Order automatically routes to assigned cashier and waiter
7. **Status Updates**: Cashier updates order status as it progresses
8. **Order Fulfillment**: Waiter delivers order and updates delivery status
9. **History Recording**: Order added to customer's history for future reference

### Benefits

**For Customers:**

- Faster ordering process
- Transparency in order status
- Personalized experience with order history
- Reduced wait times

**For Restaurant:**

- Improved operational efficiency
- Reduced order errors
- Better resource allocation
- Data-driven insights into popular items and customer preferences
- Enhanced customer satisfaction

**For Staff:**

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Spring Boot (Java)
- **Data Persistence**: Local Storage (client-side), Spring Boot + Database (server-side)

### Success Metrics

- Average order processing time
- Customer satisfaction ratings
- Order accuracy rate
- Staff efficiency improvements
